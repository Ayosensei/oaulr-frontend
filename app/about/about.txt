INTRODUCTION AND THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND 
The then University of Ife Law Reports (UILR) now Obafemi Awolowo University Law Reports (OAULR) was known throughout the Common Law countries as one of the best reported Law Reports. It is a baby of the Faculty of Law, Obafemi Awolowo University,Ile Ife.
The Faculty was the first and remains the only one in Nigeria that has such a project. The Law Reports came into existence in 1971. It was seen at the time and up till now, primarily as a research work.
From the early 1970s to  1980s the OAULR  was one of the most cited Law Reports in the superior courts in Nigeria. There was regular publication of the Reports which were then printed in Parts from 1971. That era closed with the production of Volume 7 in the early 1980s. From that time until the late 2000s the Reports for some reasons suffered set back.
The current era began with the publication of the (2008) OAULR and since then the work had been consistently published.
The following immortal comments by respected members of the legal profession and many others shows how  reputable the Reports have been. Viz:
" I have been a fan of your undoubtedly well edited and nicely produced Law Reports which l consider a worthy contribution to knowledge and to legal profession."
         - Chief R. A. Akinjide,one time Attorney General of the Federation.

"After reading through your Law Reports l am convinced that the standard of Reports compares in everything with the Weekly Law Reports published in London. In style,it is modem,in the choice of cases to be reported,it is uniquely selective......."
         -Hon. Justice Adewale Thompson, the then Western State of Nigeria High Court.
