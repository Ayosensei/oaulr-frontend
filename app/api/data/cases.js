  "JURISDICTION_ISSUE": "ADMIRALTY JURISDICTION OF FEDERAL HIGH COURT VIS A VIS STATE/FCT HIGH COURT - Section 1(1) & (2) of the Admiralty Jurisdiction Act 1991 & enactment of the concept of Dry Port - Scope of – Whether extended the Admiralty Jurisdiction to claims for damage to goods which occurred after offloading from ship and where the Contract is unconnected with Carriage of goods by the Sea - Decisions in Petrojessica Enterprises Ltd. v. Leventis Technical Ltd. - Applicability after the enactment of Section 1(2) of the Admiralty Act 1991",
  "FACTS": "In 1993, the 1st Appellant imported a diesel engine from the UK, carried by sea to Port Harcourt. The Appellant contracted the Respondent to clear the engine at the port and deliver it by road to Calabar. The Respondent subcontracted the delivery, resulting in damage to the engine. The Appellants sued in Lagos State High Court, which held it had jurisdiction, as the claim was no longer maritime once the cargo was offloaded. The Court of Appeal reversed, claiming it was an admiralty matter. The Appellants appealed to the Supreme Court to resolve the jurisdictional question.",
  "ISSUES_FOR_DETERMINATION": [
    "1. Whether the Court of Appeal was correct in holding that the Appellants' claim for damages was an Admiralty matter vesting jurisdiction in the Federal High Court.",
    "2. Whether the facts constituted a cause of action in Admiralty under S.1(1)(g) & (2) of the Admiralty Jurisdiction Act 1991 for goods already discharged and transported by land.",
    "3. Whether the Court of Appeal was correct in its interpretation of prior case law regarding Sections 1(1)(g) & (2) of the Admiralty Jurisdiction Act 1991."
  ],
  "HELD": "The Supreme Court held that once cargo is discharged from a ship at the port, admiralty jurisdiction ceases. Section 1(2) of the Admiralty Jurisdiction Act allows for admiralty jurisdiction over contracts combining sea and land carriage, but only while the land transport is a continuation of the sea contract. In this case, the Respondent's duty was independent land carriage after delivery at Port Harcourt. The Court of Appeal erred in extending admiralty jurisdiction beyond the port. The trial Court had jurisdiction under ordinary contract law. Appeal allowed, trial Court decision restored.",

  "FACTS": "The Respondent sued the Appellant in the Rivers State High Court for trespass on disputed property. The Respondent claimed ownership based on purchase from the Abandoned Property Implementation Committee and exercised rights including tenancy collection. The Appellant counter-claimed, asserting family ownership based on historical possession and Exhibit G (Customary Court judgment). The trial Court ruled in favor of the Respondent, dismissing the counter-claim, holding the Appellant had no evidence connecting him to the property prior to 1989–1992 and that Exhibit G was irrelevant. The Appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal, which affirmed the trial Court’s decision. The Appellant further appealed to the Supreme Court.",

    "(3) Whether the Court below was right to hold that the Appellant trespassed onto the disputed property."

  "HELD": "The Supreme Court held that: 1) A Notice of Appeal is an originating process; defects can rob the Court of jurisdiction. 2) Non-payment of filing fees renders the appeal null. 3) Courts should not raise issues suo motu without giving parties a chance to be heard, except in limited circumstances. 4) Burden of proof in civil claims shifts according to Sections 131–133 of the Evidence Act, 2011. 5) Proof of title by traditional history requires cogent, consistent evidence of ownership devolution. The Appellant failed to provide credible evidence of family ownership, and Exhibit G was insufficient to establish title. Concurrent findings by the lower courts were correct, and the Appellant's actions constituted trespass. The appeal lacked merit and was dismissed; Respondent awarded costs of N1,000,000.",

I shall make a short comment on the issue of locus standi. My lords, the question of locus standi has received judicial consideration in many cases which have come before this Court, and the applicant has referred us to the case of Adesanya Vs. The President of Nigeria (2) (Supra). In the said case, the ratio decidendi was that when a man comes to Court and prays the Court to look into dispute between him and any person, or body he must show legal interest entitling him to ask for the intervention of the Court. In the case of Senator Adesanya Vs The President (2) (Supra) Idigbe, JSC at page 387, declared: \"the type of case or dispute which will Justify the exercise of the Court of its Judicial Power must to be Justiciable and based on a bonafide assertion of right by the litigant (or one of them) before it.\" All these authorities relate to civil matters and are not difficult to comprehend. The novel issue on this appeal is concerned with legal interest which the 1st Respondent must possess before he can commence proceeding. From the facts of the case Chief Gani Fawehinmi, SAN originated the action. His originating processes indicated he is a Nigerian; he was the Chairman of National Conscience Party. He was former presidential Candidate. He was a tax payer. A Senior Advocate of Nigeria etc. The question is, will the above be sufficient to grant him the locus standi to bring this action? These and other questions are bound to agitate the mind of any objective enquirer and it’s for this reason that the Court has to exercise some caution before giving a stamp of legality to this type of interest lest one flings open the door to busy-bodies who might want exploit the slightest opportunity to embarrass innocent citizens of this country. From the record of proceeding I read, the facts he is tax payer without facts of being such is fatal to his claim. In all these circumstances, I think that this appeal must succeed and I allow it. I hereby set aside the judgment of the lower Court. The originating summon, too is hereby struck out accordingly. Parties to bear their costs."

      "FACTS": "By way of an originating summons the Appellant (as Plaintiff) commenced this action before the High Court of Lagos State against the Respondents. It asked the Court to determine whether the Respondents can validly and rightly carry on and or operate any form of Lottery business within the territory of Lagos State without first obtaining a duly issued licence from the Executive Governor of the State in accordance with the provisions of the Lagos State Lotteries Law 2004. The Respondents filed a Notice of Preliminary Objection challenging the jurisdiction of the Court in that the issue raised directly or indirectly involve the validity of a license granted by the Federal government of Nigeria to the respondents for establishment of Lottery trade throughout the country and that such were within the  exclusive legislative list of the National Assembly, as such pursuant to the provisions of Section 251 (1) (p) and (r) of the Constitution it was the Federal High Court that is vested with the jurisdiction to entertain the matter. The trial Court overruled and dismissed the objection. The Respondents' appeal to the Court of Appeal which allowed the appeal. The Appellant was aggrieved by the decision and has therefore brought this appeal.",

        "1. Whether the action against the respondents or the reliefs sought by the Appellant in the Originating Summons amount to a challenge of the validity of an executive or administrative action of Federal Government and the High Court of the State is therefore deprived of Jurisdiction to entertain the action.",
        "2. Whether the Court below was right to have declined to consider and determine issues 2 and 3 raised in the appeal."
      ],
      "HELD": "JURISDICTION – Jurisdiction of the State High Court vis a vis the Federal High Court –Jurisdiction of State High Court - Ambit of under Section 272 – Federal High Court - and 251 of the Constitution 1. that Courts of law being creatures of the statutes; including the Constitution, derive their jurisdiction to adjudicate over matters brought before them from the same statutes that create them, they therefore only exercise the jurisdiction conferred in them by such statutes; 2. that where jurisdiction is not conferred or vested in a Court under the statute which created or established it, then it cannot purport to assume and exercise jurisdiction it does not statutorily have; 3. that the jurisdiction vested or conferred on the High Court of a State in Nigeria to hear and determine the existence or extent of a legal, liability, interest or claim, etc, in civil proceedings, is very wide and extensive, made subject only to the provision of Section 251 and other provisions of the Constitution; 4. that the High Court of State possesses jurisdiction to adjudicate over cases/matters/actions which do not involve or affect the jurisdiction vested by or under Section 251 or other provisions of the Constitution in other Courts specifically named in the provisions; 5. that the jurisdiction conferred or vested in the High Court of a State under Section 272 of the Constitution, above, is made subject to, in particular, Section 251 of the Constitution; 6. that the High Court of a State would therefore lack and does not have jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate over matters for which the Federal High Court is specifically vested or conferred with jurisdiction under the provision of Section 251; 7. that in any civil action by which the validity of an executive or administrative action or decision by the Federal Government or any of its agencies is challenged and the reliefs for declarations and injunction are sought, it is the Federal High Court that exclusively possesses the requisite judicial power and authority or jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate by virtue of the provision in paragraph or item (r) of Section 251 (1); 8. that the answer lies in the nature, contents and context of the claims and the facts upon which the case is predicated, as disclosed in the originating summons as well as the Affidavit filed in support thereof; 9. that none of the Respondents who are unquestionably private companies could be said to be an agency of the Federal Government; 10. that all that the question seek to know from the trial Court is whether the Respondents can lawfully and validly operate, conduct or carry out the business of lottery in Lagos State without compliance with the requirement of the 2004 Law of Lagos State, such question does not raise the issue of the competence of or authority of any agency of the Federal Government to issue a licence to the Respondents; 11. that it is extraneous, as was erroneously done by the Court below, to import into the Appellant's case, the question of the validity of the licence issued to the Respondents as the only basis on which it concluded that the case sought to challenge an executive or administrative action of the Federal Government; 12. that the case presented in the Originating Summons filed by the Appellant before the trial Court is one which can be completely, effectually and finally determined without a determination of the validity of the licence issued to the Respondents since it was not raised in the question as well as the reliefs sought therein by the Appellant, the suit is simp...(truncated 36366 characters)...ties to an appeal, inspite or despite its views on one (1) or only some of those issues since its decision on the issues determined is subject to a further appeal at which it may be faulted in law, reversed and set aside. This position was restated by this Court in Adah v. NYSC (41) at 143 - 144, per Uwaifo, JSC in the lead judgment; a case decided years before the judgment appealed against, wherein His Lordship said:- \"The Court below, not being the final Court had a duty to decide the merit of the case upon the issues canvassed before it, notwithstanding that it resolved the issue of jurisdiction to the effect that the Benue State High Court lacked jurisdiction. This is because if an appeal to this Court was reversed on that issue, it would prevent the necessity of remitting the appeal to it to resolve the other issues arising from the appeal as originally made to it. See Ezeoke v. Nwagbo (1988) 1 NWLR (pt. 72) 616, Bayol v. Ahemba (1999) 7 SC (pt. 92) 92; (1999) 7 SCNJ 223. The Court below was in error to have failed to resolve all the issues canvassed before it rather than confine itself only to the issue of jurisdiction.\" Tobi, JSC, in his concurring judgment, restated that:- \"All Courts below the Supreme Court are bound to take all issues canvassed by the parties, even when such issues appear superfluous or spent. This is to enable the Court exercising appellate jurisdiction to determine the issues, even if in the alternative. I think this Court has the exclusive jurisdiction or should I say prerogative, to do what the Court of Appeal did because it is the final bus stop of any litigation.\" See Also Katto v. CBN (42), Titiloye v. Olupo (43), Cookey v. Fombo (44), Tanko v. UBA, Plc (45), Nwankwo v. Yar'adua (46), Toyrex Nig. Ltd. v. Pfizer (47) at 167. In the result, the Court below is clearly wrong in law to have failed/refused to consider and make pronouncements on the other issues canvased before it by the parties in the judgment appealed against and thereby unwittingly, infringing on the parties' right to fair hearing in the determination of the appeal. See Dasuki v. FRN (48) at 343, PDP v. INEC (49) at 556, Usararen v. FRN (50) at 234 (SC), Ikpeazu v. Otti (51). In the final result, I find merit in the appeal and allow it. As a consequence, the decision by the Court below that the trial Court lacks the requisite jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate over the Appellant's suit against the Respondents, delivered on the 16th July, 2008, is hereby set aside. The suit is restored on the Cause List of the trial Court for determination and ordered to be remitted to the Chief Judge of Lagos State for the purpose. The parties shall bear their respective costs of prosecuting the appeal. MUSA DATTIJO MUHAMMAD, J.S.C.: Being in entire agreement with the reasoning and conclusion expressed in the lead judgment of my learned brother, Mohammed Lawal Garba JSC, I adopt same in allowing the meritorious appeal. I also imbibe the consequential orders effected in the lead judgment. CHIMA CENTUS NWEZE, J.S.C.: I had the advantage of reading the draft of the leading judgment which my Lord, Garba, JSC, delivered now. I agree with His Lordship that this appeal, being meritorious, should be allowed. Section 251 (1) (r) of the 1999 Constitution, (as amended), provides that the Federal High Court shall have and exercise jurisdiction to the exclusion of any other Court in \"(r) any action or proceeding for a declaration or injunction affecting the validity of any executive or administrative action or decision by the Federal Government or any of its agencies.\" In effect, in actions under this provision, the Court would be required to resolve three Sub-questions (i) whether the claim relates to the validity of any executive or administrative action or decision; (ii) if the either of the parties is the Federal Government or any of its agencies and (iii) the nature of the reliefs, that is, whether they are for declaration; injunction; damages or specific performance. PDP v Sylva (52) at 52-53, G-E, Oloruntoba-Oju v. Dopamu (53) at 815-816; 829-830, A-C, University of Abuja v Ologe (supra) 722, PDP v Sylva (54) at 52-53, G-E, Ladoja v INEC (55) at 27-28, G-D, Obi v INEC (56) at 636-637, G-C; 638, B-E. I entirely agree with the leading judgment that the suit, culminating into this appeal, is simply one that is, entirely, based on the interpretation and application of the 2004 Laws of Lagos State in relation to the respondent's operation, conduct and carrying on the Lottery Business in Lagos State. It is for these, and the more elaborate, reasons in the leading judgement that I too hold that this appeal is meritorious. I hereby enter an order allowing it. I abide by the consequential orders in the leading judgment. UWANI MUSA ABBA AJI, J.S.C.: The Appellant as plaintiff in the trial Court sought for determination \"whether the Respondents can validly and rightly carry on, conduct and or operate any form of Lottery business within the territory of Lagos State by whatever means or mode without first obtaining a duly issued license from the Executive Governor of Lagos State in accordance with the provisions of the Lagos State Lotteries Law, 2004.\" It is clear that it is the interpretation of the \"provisions of the Lagos State Lotteries Law, 2004\" that the Appellant sought for. Thus, the ingredients and requirements for bringing a matter under Section 251 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) do not present themselves in this case to confer exclusive jurisdiction on the Federal High Court and not the State High Court. The trial Court rightly decided that the Appellant's suit \"seeks an interpretation of 2004 Lagos State Lotteries Law\" and not for \"determination of matters within the exclusive legislative list of the National Assembly of Nigeria\" and same is endorsed by me. My learned brother, Mohammed Lawal Garba, JSC, has sagely and with great judicial balance, handled the appeal and his reasoning and conclusion do not need tampering. I agree with him that the appeal be allowed. HELEN MORONKEJI OGUNWUMIJU, J.S.C.: I have read the draft of the judgment just delivered by my learned brother, Mohammed Lawal Garba, JSC. I agree with His Lordship's reasoning and conclusion that this appeal is meritorious and should be allowed. The judgment has been exhaustive on all the issues for determination and there is nothing useful to add to it. Appeal allowed.",

  "FACTS": "The Appellant supplied 4 cruise boats under a contract with the 1st Respondent, with negotiations mainly in Abuja. After partial payment by the Respondents, the Appellant sued in the FCT High Court for the balance. The Respondents argued the court lacked jurisdiction as the contract was executed and the parties resided in Rivers State. The Court of Appeal agreed, citing FCT High Court Rules and constitutional provisions, and dismissed the suit. The Appellant appealed to the Supreme Court.",

  "HELD": "The Supreme Court held that negotiation alone does not establish a contract. Territorial jurisdiction is limited to the area where the court is established. For breach of contract cases, jurisdiction depends on where the contract was made, to be performed, or where the defendant resides. Since the contract was executed in Rivers State, the FCT High Court lacked jurisdiction. Filing the suit in Abuja was deemed forum shopping. Appeal dismissed.",

    "KUDIRAT KEKERE-EKUN, J.S.C.: I have had the privilege of reading in draft the judgment of my learned brother, Helen Moronkeji Ogunwumiju, JSC, just delivered. I agree with His Lordship that the appeal lacks merit and should be dismissed. I accordingly dismiss the appeal and abide by the consequential orders made in the lead judgment.",

I agree with His Lordship that the appeal lacks merit and should be dismissed. I accordingly dismiss the appeal and abide by the consequential orders made in the lead judgment.",
    "ADAMU JAURO, J.S.C.: I have had the advantage of a preview of the judgment just delivered by my learned brother, Helen Moronkeji Ogunwumiju, JSC. I agree in toto with the reasoning and conclusion reached. The only relevant issue arising for determination is whether the lower Court was right in its decision that the Appellant's claim was outside the territorial jurisdiction of the High Court of the FCT. Territorial jurisdiction refers to the power or authority of a Court to adjudicate over matters which occur or arise within a territory or geographical area. See Veepee Ind. Ltd. v. O.F. (Nig.) Ltd. (50); Audu v. APC & Ors. (36) (Supra) (SC); Roda v. F.R.N. (51); Dariye v. FRN (26) (Supra) (SC). Some relevant provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) in relation to the jurisdiction of the High Court of the FCT are set out below. Section 6(2): \"The judicial powers of a State shall be vested in the Courts to which this Section relates, being Courts established, subject as provided by this Constitution, for a State.\" Section 6(5)(d): \"(5) This Section relates to – (d) the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.\" Section 255(1): \"There shall be a High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.\" Section 257: \"(1) Subject to the provisions of Section 251 and any other provisions of this Constitution and in addition to such other jurisdiction as may be conferred upon it by law, the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any civil proceedings in which the existence or extent of a legal right, power, duty, liability, privilege, interest, obligation or claim is in issue or to hear and determine any criminal proceedings involving or relating to any penalty, forfeiture, punishment or other liability in respect of an offence committed by any person. (2) The reference to civil or criminal proceedings in this Section includes a reference to the proceedings which originate in the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja and those which are brought before the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja to be dealt with by the Court in the exercise of its appellate or supervisory jurisdiction.\" Section 299: \"The provisions of this Constitution shall apply to the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja as if it were one of the States of the Federation; and accordingly- (a) all the legislative powers, the executive powers and the judicial powers vested in the House of Assembly, the Governor of a State and in the Courts of a State shall, respectively, vest in the National Assembly, the President of the Federation and in the Courts which by virtue of the foregoing provisions are Courts established for the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja; (b) all the powers referred to in paragraph (a) of this Section shall be exercised in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution; and (c) the provisions of this Constitution pertaining to the matters aforesaid shall be read with such modifications and adaptations as may be reasonably necessary to bring them into conformity with the provisions of this Section.\" The import of the foregoing provisions is that the jurisdiction of the High Court of the FCT does not extend beyond the geographical boundaries of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. Particularly, by virtue of Section 299 of the Constitution, the FCT High Court is no different from a State High Court serving the FCT. Thus, like the High Courts of the States of the Federation, the jurisdiction of the High Court of the FCT does not extend to matters arising outside the FCT. See Audu v. A.P.C. (36) (Supra); Mailantarki v. Tongo (25) (Supra). Although the Respondent did not enter an appearance or file a defence to the Appellant's suit before the trial Court, that cannot operate to vest jurisdiction on the Court when it clearly lacked same. The argument of the Appellant in this appeal is that the contract between the parties was made in Abuja, thus the trial Court had jurisdiction. In the Appellant's estimation the deposition in paragraphs 8 and 9 in its affidavit evidence before the trial Court was sufficient proof that the contract was made in Abuja. The said paragraphs 8 and 9 are set out below: \"8. That the negotiation most of which took place in Abuja was between the Managing Director of the Plaintiff and the Executive Head of State of the Defendants. 9. The Plaintiff accepted and as a result placed an order abroad and was supplied with four princess cruise boats which he eventually supplied to the Defendants.\" 10. The above paragraphs are not helpful in determining where the contract was made. They are only of assistance in telling us where the negotiation or most of it took place. Negotiation does not imply entering into an agreement or a contract. Negotiation is at best a precursor or prelude to reaching an agreement. There may well be negotiation which does not germinate into a contract or agreement as a result of the inability to reach a compromise. If negotiation was synonymous to making a contract as the Appellant is arguing, there would be no need to state in paragraph 9 of the Appellant's affidavit that \"the Plaintiff accepted...\" Hence, there is no proof that the contract was made in Abuja and the effect of this is that there is no element of the case that vests jurisdiction in the High Court of the FCT. The implication is that the trial Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the Appellant's claim. The claim as well as the entire proceedings before the trial Court are a nullity and hereby struck out. For these reasons and the more elaborate ones enunciated in the lead judgment, the appeal is also dismissed by me.",
    "TIJJANI ABUBAKAR, J.S.C.: I had the advantage of reading before now the comprehensive leading Judgment of my learned brother Helen Moronkeji Ogunwumiju, JSC. I endorse the entire reasoning and conclusion and adopt the judgment as my own. I have nothing extra to add."
