  "story_of_the_case": "In 1993, Glenyork Nigeria Limited, a company running a power project in the Export Processing Zone (EPZ) in Calabar, ordered a massive 12RK Ruston Diesel Power Engine (serial number IH1001B) from a manufacturer in the United Kingdom. The engine was safely loaded onto a ship, crossed the Atlantic and the Gulf of Guinea without incident, and was duly discharged at the Port Harcourt Sea Port in perfect condition. It was then moved into the customs warehouse – at that moment, the international sea carrier’s job was completely and finally done.\n\nOnce the engine was resting safely in the warehouse, Glenyork turned to Panalpina World Transport Nigeria Limited, a well-known clearing and forwarding agent. Glenyork handed over all the original shipping documents to Panalpina and paid them in full for two distinct services: (1) to clear the engine through Nigerian customs at Port Harcourt, and (2) to arrange its safe transportation by road all the way from Port Harcourt to the project site in distant Calabar, Cross River State.\n\nPanalpina accepted the job and the money. But instead of using their own trucks, they subcontracted the actual road haulage to a third-party company, Tyland Nigeria Ltd. Somewhere along the long, bumpy journey from Rivers State to Cross River State, disaster struck: the trailer carrying the multi-million-pound engine overturned, and the priceless machine tumbled off and was catastrophically damaged.\n\nGlenyork immediately called in experts from the UK manufacturer to survey the wreckage. The damage was so severe that Royal Re-Insurance Co. Ltd (the second plaintiff) had no choice but to pay out the full insured value – a whopping £95,027.28 – to Glenyork. Having indemnified their client, the insurers stepped into Glenyork’s shoes (via subrogation) and, together, they sued Panalpina in the Lagos State High Court for breach of contract, negligence, and breach of duty as a bailee and carrier for reward.\n\nThat is how a straightforward road-transport accident in the Nigerian hinterland ended up triggering a 31-year legal odyssey all the way to the Supreme Court – a journey that would finally decide where the invisible boundary of “admiralty jurisdiction” truly lies.",

  "issues_for_determination_in_supreme_court": [
    "1. Whether the Court of Appeal was right in holding that the claim was an admiralty matter vesting exclusive jurisdiction in the Federal High Court.",
    "2. Whether the facts pleaded constitute a cause of action in admiralty under sections 1(1)(g) & (2) of the Admiralty Jurisdiction Act 1991 so as to make the inland road transportation an extension of carriage by sea.",
    "3. Whether the Court of Appeal was correct to declare that the long-standing decisions in P.E. Ltd v. Leventis Technical Ltd (1992) and Aluminium Manufacturing Co. Nig. Ltd v. NPA (1987) are no longer good law."
  ],

  "appellants_counsel_defence_summary": "The Appellants argued that the sea voyage ended the moment the engine was safely discharged into the customs warehouse. What followed was a completely separate, domestic contract for customs clearance and pure road transportation. Section 1(2) of the 1991 Act was never intended to convert every subsequent inland haulage contract into an admiralty matter. They relied heavily on the still-binding authorities of P.E. Ltd v. Leventis and Aluminium v. NPA, insisting that once goods are off the ship and in the warehouse without damage, admiralty jurisdiction ceases.",

  "respondent_counsel_defence_summary": "Panalpina contended that the innovative provisions of sections 1(1)(g) and especially 1(2) of the Admiralty Jurisdiction Act 1991 dramatically expanded admiralty jurisdiction to cover the entire chain of delivery – from the time goods are loaded overseas until they reach the consignee’s premises, irrespective of whether part of the journey is by road. They argued that the old Supreme Court decisions were decided under a narrower regime and were no longer good law after the 1991 Act and the introduction of dry ports.",

  "final_judgment": {
    "outcome": "Appeal Allowed (unanimous)",
    "core_holding": "The Supreme Court authoritatively held that section 1(2) of the Admiralty Jurisdiction Act 1991 only extends admiralty jurisdiction to the inland leg when it forms part of a single, continuous multimodal contract that begins overseas and ends with delivery to the consignee. Where, as in this case, the sea carriage contract terminated upon discharge into the customs warehouse and a new, separate contract was subsequently entered into for inland transportation, any damage occurring during that road journey is NOT an admiralty matter.",

  "story_of_the_case": "In 2004, the late Chief Gani Fawehinmi SAN, a fiery activist and tax-paying citizen, launched a crusade against what he saw as ministerial excess. He sued Finance Minister Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, claiming her $247,000 annual salary (about N36 million) violated the Certain Political Office Holders Act, which capped ministers' pay at N794,085. Joined were the President, RMAFC, and AGF. Fawehinmi sought declarations and refunds of excess payments.\n\nThe Federal High Court struck it out for lack of locus standi. But the Court of Appeal revived it, invoking Section 15 to grant reliefs. Okonjo-Iweala appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing Fawehinmi (later substituted by his son) lacked standing and the appellate court overreached.\n\nA landmark on citizen suits, the apex court ruled strict locus needed for executive actions, not just constitutional breaches – no tax proof, no standing.",

  ],

  "appellants_counsel_defence_summary": "The Appellant argued the 1st Respondent lacked locus standi, showing no personal interest violated; mere taxpayer status without evidence (e.g., tax certificate) insufficient. Precedents like Adesanya v. President emphasized direct interest. Also, Court of Appeal erred invoking Section 16 without remitting to trial court, divesting original jurisdiction.",

  "respondent_counsel_defence_summary": "The Respondents contended as taxpayer and citizen, standing exists for public interest suits enforcing laws like the Salaries Act. Liberal locus for constitutional vindication per Owodunni v. Reg. Trustees of CCC. Section 16 properly invoked as all facts available; no need for oral evidence.",

  "final_judgment": {

  "story_of_the_case": "In 2000, Ajayi, a seasoned Chartered Accountant and Finance Manager at African Petroleum Plc, found himself entangled in a financial scandal. He was accused of authorizing a prospectus for a share sale that understated the company's debt by over N12 billion – claiming N10.2 billion when the real figure exceeded N22 billion. The Securities and Exchange Commission's Administrative Proceedings Committee (APC) slapped him with penalties on April 19, 2004, without him appearing, though the SEC insisted he was served notice but chose not to attend.\n\nFeeling aggrieved and claiming denial of fair hearing, Ajayi sued at the Federal High Court in Abuja to quash the APC's decision via certiorari. But the court declined jurisdiction, transferring the case to the Investments and Securities Tribunal (IST). Unhappy, he appealed to the Court of Appeal, which upheld the trial court's ruling. Still determined, Ajayi took his fight to the Supreme Court, arguing that the Federal High Court should have handled it and that the APC's process violated natural justice.\n\nThis case, spanning over a decade, tested the boundaries of jurisdiction between the Federal High Court and the IST in capital market disputes, ultimately affirming that such grievances belong to the specialized tribunal.",

He contended that the IST lacks power to grant certiorari or injunctions, and the Federal High Court retains jurisdiction under Section 14(1) of its Act. Reliance was placed on precedents like Ebong v. SEC and Sonnar (Nig.) Ltd v. Partenreedri, emphasizing that the suit challenges the process, not just the decision, and should not be confined to the IST.",

They argued the suit is a grievance against the APC's decision, reviewable only by the IST, and the Federal High Court properly transferred it. Precedents like City Engineering Nig. Ltd v. Nigerian Airport Authority supported giving statutes their plain meaning, rejecting certiorari outside the IST's purview.",

The trial court dismissed the objection, but the Court of Appeal reversed, agreeing it was a federal matter. Undeterred, the Lagos AG appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing the suit was purely about state law compliance, not federal validity.\n\nThis battle highlighted the jurisdictional tug-of-war between state and federal courts over lottery regulation, culminating in a Supreme Court ruling that drew the line clearly.",

  "story_of_the_case": "In the ancient town of Eruwa, Oyo State, a chieftaincy dispute simmered for decades. The Laribikusi Ruling House, represented by James Olatunde Idowu and Alhaji Rasheed Oyedepo Ajao, challenged the installation of Oba Samuel Adebayo Adegbola as Eleruwa, along with his kingmakers. They claimed the process violated the 1957 Chieftaincy Declaration, seeking declarations and injunctions against the installation.\n\nThe High Court dismissed the suit, but the Court of Appeal reversed, nullifying the installation. The Supreme Court initially upheld this in 2019, but Adegbola applied for review, arguing the originating processes were unsigned and thus void. The apex court, weighing finality against justice, reviewed its judgment – a rare move – and set it aside, emphasizing that only inherent nullities from the start qualify for such reconsideration.\n\nThis saga underscored the tension between judicial finality and correcting fundamental errors in Nigeria's highest court.",

But on appeal, the Court of Appeal cried foul: this was a Port Harcourt matter through and through – parties, contract, execution all tied to Rivers. No Abuja connection justified the venue.

The Federal High Court struck it out for lacking fresh leave; the Court of Appeal affirmed.
