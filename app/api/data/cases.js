Leventis Technical Ltd. - Applicability after the enactment of Section 1(2) of the Admiralty Act 1991",
      "FACTS": "Sometimes in 1993, the 1st appellant (Plaintiff before the trial court) imported a Diesel Power Engine from the United Kingdom. The Engine was carried by sea to the sea port at Port Harcourt. Meanwhile, the 1st appellant and the respondent entered into a contract under which the later agreed to carry out customs clearance of the generator at the Port Harcourt Sea Port and transport same by road to the project site at EPZ Calabar, Cross River State. In furtherance of this contract the 1st appellant delivered the relevant shipping documents to the respondent to enable it to do the said clearance and also paid the respondent the costs of the clearance and transporting the goods to Calabar safely and securely. In breach of the contract, the respondent subcontracted the carriage to a third party. In further breach of her contractual duty to carry the goods safely, the engine was carried negligently and delivered badly damaged. Assessment of the damage was carried out and compensation demanded from the respondent who denied liability. The appellants filed an action before the Lagos State High Court. The respondent raised an objection to the jurisdiction of the Court on the ground that by virtue of S. 1(1) (g) & (2) of the Admiralty Jurisdiction Decree No. 59 of 1991 the subject matter fell within the admiralty jurisdiction of the Federal High Court. The trial Court relying on the Supreme Court case of P.E. Ltd & Anor. v. Leventis Tech Ltd. overruled the Objection and held that once the cargo was unloaded from the ship and received into the warehouse without any loss, the shippers’ obligation terminates and what follows was a simple contract of bailment and negligence, which did not relate to maritime claims. The respondent filed an appeal to the Court of Appeal which reversed the trial court’s decision. It held that the suit was an admiralty matter and within the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court. Dissatisfied the Appellants brought this appeal to the Supreme Court.",

In the light of the foregoing, the appellants acted ex debito justitae when they besieged the trial Court to ventilate their nursed grievances against the respondents over the contract of carriage of goods by land. In effect, the lower Court, with utmost reverence, fractured the law when it disrobed the trial Court of necessary jurisdiction over the adjudication of the appellants’ suit. The lower Court’s decision, with due respect, was a flagrant defilement of the letters and spirit of the law. In order to pacify the law, it has to be mowed down by the unbiased judicial sword of this Court. It is for this brief reason, coupled with the elaborate dissections marshalled in the leading judgment, that I, too, allow the appeal and restore the decision of the trial Court. Appeal allowed. MOHAMMED BABA IDRIS, J.S.C.: I have before now read the comprehensive leading judgment prepared and rendered in this appeal by my learned brother, Emmanuel Akomaye Agim, JSC. I agree with the reasoning and conclusion reached in the said judgment. The law is settled that jurisdiction is a threshold matter and it is very fundamental as it goes to the competence of the Court to hear and determine a suit. Where a Court lacks the jurisdiction to hear the matter, the entire proceeding, no matter how well conducted and decided, will amount to a nullity. Whenever the jurisdiction of a Court is challenged in an action fought on pleadings, it is the plaintiffs' claim in the writ of summons or statement of claim that is looked into to determine whether or not the Court seized of the matter has the requisite jurisdiction over the parties or the subject matter of the dispute between the parties. See Azubuogu v. Oranezi & Ors. (SC) (7) The principal claim of the plaintiffs now Appellants as contained in the amended writ of summons is for: a. The equivalent in naira of UK €95,927.28 (ninety five thousand, nine hundred and twenty seven pounds and twenty eight pence) at the autonomous rate of exchange prevailing on the date of payment being special damages suffered by the plaintiffs as a result of the defendant's breach of contract and/or for negligence, and breach of duty as a carrier for reward in conveying the plaintiff's Ruston Diesel Power Engine from Port Harcourt to Calabar. (See page 2 of the Record of Appeal) From the principal claim sought and the averments in the statement of claim when considered vis-a vis the preliminary objection, it is not in dispute that the goods in question were shipped into Nigeria and the Respondent was not the conveyor of the goods via sea. It is also not in dispute that the Respondent was engaged to clear, transport and deliver the goods from the port at Port Harcourt wharf to Calabar. The question is, where does the applicability of admiralty jurisdiction on the goods terminate? This Court has consistently held in a plethora of cases that the mere fact that goods were transported by sea at some stage of their movement does not automatically invoke admiralty jurisdiction. Once the cargo is no longer aboard a vessel or engaged in carriage by sea, the admiralty jurisdiction of the Federal High Court ceases. Any dispute arising thereafter such as the alleged damage to goods on land as in the instant suit, falls within the general jurisdiction of the State High Court under Section 236(1) of the 1979 Constitution (now Section 272(1) of the 1999 Constitution, rather than the specialized admiralty jurisdiction of the Federal High Court. See generally, the cases of Texaco Overseas (Nig) Petroleum Unltd v. Pedmar (Nig) Ltd (8) (SC); B. B. Apugo & Sons Ltd v. OHMB (5) (SC) (Supra) and Chevron (Nig) Ltd v. Lonestar Drilling (Nig) Ltd (9) (SC) amongst others. This Court per Ejiwunmi, JSC in Texaco Overseas (Nig) Petroleum Unltd. v. Pedmar (Nig) Ltd (Supra) held that: \"It must be observed that from the above pronouncements by the learned Justices of this Court, the Admiralty Jurisdiction of Federal High Court cannot be invoked once the goods carried by a ship have been discharged in the harbour or delivered to the point of destination of the cargo. In any event, for a claim in admiralty to arise, the cargo or goods must still be in the vessel.\" In the instant case, the cargo had already been discharged from the sea at its destination. The Respondent, as an independent contractor, was engaged with the duty of clearing and conveying the goods to the 1st Appellant. This clearly falls within the scope of a contract for bailment and/or the carriage of goods independent of the sea carriage. The key issue in this suit is the destination of the cargo. It is undisputed that dry ports exist in Nigeria, which allow for goods to be delivered to locations distinct from the seaports. This includes the transit of goods to their final delivery point. At this stage, the admiralty jurisdiction of the Federal High Court remains applicable under Section 1(1)(g) of the Admiralty Jurisdiction Act. However, once the cargo reaches the agreed port of delivery, it is customary practice that the goods are considered delivered to the consignee at which point the admiralty jurisdiction of the Federal High Court ceases. Therefore, the Court of Appeal erred in extending the admiralty jurisdiction of the Federal High Court in this case, as such jurisdiction terminated once the cargo was delivered to the designated port. The cases of Aluminium Manufacturing Co. Nig. Ltd v(Supra). Nigerian Ports Authority (2) (Supra) and Petrojessica Enterprises Ltd v. Leventis Technical Ltd (1) (Supra) remain applicable, as the legal provisions upon which they were decided have been re-enacted into Nigerian law and now form part of the country's legislation. These decisions have been consistently relied upon by this Court in determining matters involving the admiralty jurisdiction of the Federal High Court and the principles established therein remain valid and binding. The trial Court was correct to rely on these principles, as they continue to apply under the reenacted laws. Conversely, the Court of Appeal erred by failing to recognize that the statutory provisions underpinning these principles remain part of Nigerian law, thereby upholding their continued relevance and applicability. On the whole, I am of the opinion that the decision of the Court of Appeal was reached in error and should therefore be set aside. The trial Court possesses the requisite jurisdiction to adjudicate over the matter as the dispute is one of simple contract, hence, the case should be remitted to the trial Court for the determination of the substantive suit. For these reasons, and the more comprehensive reasons set out in the lead judgment, the appeal is allowed. APPEAL ALLOWED",

      "FACTS": "The Respondent (Plaintiff at the trial court) instituted an action before the Rivers State High Court claiming damages and injunctive reliefs against the Appellant for trespass on to the disputed property. It was the Respondent’s case that by a letter dated the 27/04/1978, the Abandoned Property Implementation Committee offered a building to him for sale at the sum of N5,800. He accepted the offer, purchased, entered into possession and exercised ownership rights over it including demanding for rent from tenants. He also applied for Certificate of Occupancy in respect of the land and it was granted. He further claimed that the tenants were owing rent in arrears and that he instituted an action against them at the Rent Tribunal and that while the case was pending, the Appellant entered into the premises without permission and forcibly ejected the tenants and removed all doors and windows of the building and caused extensive damage to it. He stated that as a result, the tenants absconded without paying the outstanding rents and mesne profit. The Appellant filed his Statement of Defence and a Counter-claim, stating that he was defending the action on behalf of himself and his family. It was his case that the property belonged to his family and that it was not an abandoned property. That sometime in 1958, one Kalu Okoro, an Ibo man without authority erected a building on the land. He later left and his son Victor, moved in and refused to leave the house, that he ejected all the occupants in the house by filing a suit against the said Victor before the Customary Court and obtained judgement. The judgment was admitted as Exhibit G. He stated further that he took possession of the property in July 1992 and embarked on the renovation when the Respondent surfaced and claimed ownership. He asked for declaration that his family is the owner and entitled to the right of occupancy over the disputed property The trial court granted the respondent’s relief and dismissed the appellant’s counter claim.  It held that there was no evidence connecting the Appellant and his family to the property before 1989 and 1992, that there was nothing to show that the Appellant had the authority of his family to bring or defend the matters and that the appellant’s reliance on Exhibit G, a judgment from a Customary Court was of no consequence for lack of jurisdiction over land located in urban areas. Dissatisfied with the judgment of the trial Court, the Appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal. The Court also held that the Appellant had the duty to join the APIC as a proper and necessary party if he really wanted to show that the property was not an abandoned property. It was further held that Exhibit G relied on by the Appellant was a nullity. Still dissatisfied, the Appellant has appealed to the Supreme Court.",

See the cases of Idundun v. Okumagba (12) and Dike & Ors v. Okoloedo & Ors (13) at Pp. 12 -13 Paras. G. It is now well-settled that a person relying on traditional history as the evidence of his title must give a consistent evidence as to the devolution of such title over the years. There must also be evidence as to how the persons claiming to be the present owners of the land derived their interest and root from those who first settled on the land. See Osidele & Ors Vs. Sokunbi(SC) (14) at Pp. 21 – 22 Paras. F). Where a party predicates his claims to title to the land in dispute on traditional history for which they must adduce credible, cogent and uncontradicted evidence to establish their title. Annonye Wachukwu & Anor v. Amadike Owunwanne & Anor (15) at 229, Aikhionbare v. Omoregie (16) and Nruamah & Ors v. Ebuzoeme & Ors. (SC) (17) at p.36 paras.D. The Appellant insisted that the property belonged to his family but has failed woefully in tendering any evidence to prove same. The Appellant merely said that the land belonged to his family and that one Ibo man named Kalu Okoro unlawfully entered into the land and erected a building and lived there for years. There is no evidence before this Court to support this statement and no testimony from any other member of the family. Nothing at all! The learned counsel for the Appellant in paragraph 4.15 of his brief of argument, argued that the Appellant pleaded the traditional history of his Chinweazu family ownership in dispute and they were unchallenged by the Respondent and thus, it should be accepted as proof of the fact. Inasmuch as I cannot see any cogent traditional history being pleaded by the Appellant, I can see that the Respondent has pleaded and traced his own root of title. When placing both evidences on the balance of probability, the Respondent undoubtedly had and proved a better title. The Appellant in one breath said that he never pleaded or gave evidence or deposed that Exhibit G gave him title to the land in dispute as the two Courts below held. The Appellant's counsel said that Exhibit G was tendered in evidence as an act of possession which he never stated before the two lower Courts and not to show title to land. Then in another breath, the appellant has argued that the two lower Courts had no right to declare Exhibit G null and void since they did not ascertain through a survey map, if indeed it was situated in an urban area. The case of the Appellant is fraught with many inconsistencies and contradictions, making his case difficult to believe. Having decided that the Appellant had no title to the land and not the rightful owner of the land in dispute, the acts of the Appellant entering into the land and making renovation amounts to trespass and thus, the two lower Courts were right to have held same. In the circumstances, this appeal has been a monumental waste of the time of this Court. 33 years has been a long time coming and I believe the Respondent or his relatives can now take a breath of fresh air and enjoy the ownership of the land. This appeal is bereft of any merit and it is therefore hereby dismissed. The concurrent judgments of the two lower Courts are hereby affirmed. The Respondent is entitled to costs which is assessed at N1,000,000 (One Million Naira) to be paid by the Appellant. EMMANUEL AKOMAYE AGIM, J.S.C.: I had a preview of the judgment delivered by my learned brother, Lord Justice, MOHAMMED BABA IDRIS, JSC. I completely agree with the reasoning, conclusions, decisions therein. CHIOMA EGONDU NWOSU-IHEME, J.S.C.: I was privileged to have read in advance, the draft of the judgment just delivered by my learned brother, Mohammed Baba Idris, JSC. I agree entirely with the reasoning and conclusion that there is no merit in this appeal and that it stands dismissed. The concurrent judgments of the two lower Courts are hereby affirmed.

I agree with the reasoning and conclusion reached by my leaned brother that this appeal is devoid of merit and that same be dismissed. I recognize that this appeal is against the concurrent findings of fact made by the two Courts below. The two Courts below were ad idem that the property in dispute situate at No. 9, Lumumba Street, Diobu, Port Harcourt was abandoned property. Furthermore, that the evidence of customary title raised in the Counter-Claim did not meet the requirements of law in prove of title by traditional history. The Appellant was unable to establish by this appeal why the concurrent findings of facts made by the two Courts below should be disturbed. Upon reading the pleadings and evidence adduced in prove thereof, I have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the two Courts below were right in their evaluation of the evidence on record and conclusion reached thereon. See Kolo v. Lawan (SC) (18) and Roe Ltd v UNN(SC) (19). In Eyong Idam v Federal Republic of Nigeria (SC)(20), this Court, per Galumje, JSC held as follows: \"Finally, this appeal is against the concurrent findings of the trial Court and the Court of appeal and the attitude of this Court is that it will not interfere with those findings, unless it is shown that they are perverse. The Appellant has failed to convince me to so interfere with these concurrent findings....\" Similarly, in the instant case, I am unable to find any perversity in the findings of fact made by the trial Court and the Court of Appeal. Consequently, I am in agreement with my learned brother in the lead judgment that this appeal be dismissed. I abide by the order as to costs. HABEEB ADEWALE OLUMUYIWA ABIRU, J.S.C.: This is an appeal against the judgment of the Court of Appeal sitting in its Port Harcourt Judicial Division and delivered on the 28th of April, 2005 in Appeal No. CA/PH/96/2001, and which upheld the judgment of the High Court of Rivers State on the 29th of May, 1998 in Suit No PHC/512/92. I have had the privilege of reading before now the lead judgment delivered by my learned brother, Mohammed Baba ldris, JSC.

The Appellant has failed to convince me to so interfere with these concurrent findings....\" Similarly, in the instant case, I am unable to find any perversity in the findings of fact made by the trial Court and the Court of Appeal.

      "FACTS": "The Appellants (then Plaintiffs) initiated derivative proceedings following the grant of leave in Suit No: FHC/L/CS/1286/2009 - Afribank of Nigeria Plc & 50 Ors v. Central Bank of Nigeria & 13 Ors. In the action, the Appellants sought various declaratory and injunctive reliefs against the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) over an alleged unlawful interference with the operations and governance of the 1st Appellant. During the pendency of the action, the 1st Appellant's operational banking license was allegedly revoked, and its management and operations were subsequently assumed by the 1st and 2nd Respondents. The Appellants were not happy at the development. They promptly filed a fresh originating summons at the Federal High Court in Lagos against the Respondents to restrain further purported unlawful actions. The Respondents raised objections to the trial Court's jurisdiction on the ground that the Appellants failed to secure the necessary leave to initiate the fresh originating summons as a derivative action. The trial Court upheld the objection. It struck out the suit for failure to obtain the leave of Court. Dissatisfied, the Appellants appealed to the Court of Appeal and argued that the leave obtained in the earlier Suit No: FHC/L/CS/1286/2009 sufficed to satisfy the requirement for leave in the present originating summons, as they had acquired a vested right by virtue of the prior proceedings. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, holding that the leave obtained in earlier action could not be applied to the present originating summons. Still aggrieved the Appellants appealed to the Supreme Court.",

Appeal Dismissed Cases referred to: 1. Obi v. INE...(truncated 28259 characters)...ion is a legal procedure by which a shareholder or a member of a company institutes an action on behalf of the company against the directors or officers of the company for a wrong done to the company. The shareholder or member of the company stands in the place of the company and the benefit goes to the company and not the individual directly. Agip (Nig) Ltd v. Agip Petroli International (4) (Supra), Esiso v. Esiso (CA) (16) A shareholder or member of a company desirous of commencing a derivative action is obligated to show that he gave adequate notice of the impending action to the directors of the company, that he is acting in good faith and that the action is in the interest of the company. These statutory conditions for a derivative action are set in Section 303 of Companies and Allied Matters Act which provides that: \"1. Subject to the provisions of Subsection (2) of this section, an applicant may apply to the Court for leave to bring an action in the name or on behalf of a company or to intervene in an action to which the company is a party, for the purpose of prosecuting, defending or discontinuing the action on behalf of the company. 2. No action may be brought and no intervention may be made under Subsection (1) of this Section, unless the Court is satisfied that: a. The wrong doers are the directors who are in control and will not take necessary action. b. The applicant has given reasonable notice to the directors of the company of his intention to apply to the Court under Subsection (1) of this Section if the directors of the company do not bring, diligently prosecute or defend or discontinue the action. c. The application is in good faith; and d. It appears to be in the best interest of the company that the action be brought prosecuted, defended or discontinued.\" Dovetailing from the above provision, the law is settled that it is a statutory condition that a party desirous of commencing a derivative action must first seek for and obtain leave of Court to do so. It is at the stage of the application for leave that the party is required to satisfy the Court on the requirements listed as (a), (b), (c) and (d) under in Section 303 of Companies and Allied Matters Act - West African Oil Fields Services Ltd v. Gregory (CA) (17), Citec International Estates Ltd v. Francis(SC)(18) Agatha Gardens & Hotels Investment Ltd v. Administrator General & Public Trustee, Akwa lbom State(CA) (19) Where a party fails to seek for and obtain leave of Court before commencing a derivative action, the action is incompetent. In Adeogun-Phillips v. Gateway Portland Cement Ltd (CA) (20), the Court made the point thus: \"...I disagree with the Respondents' argument that this suit was instituted in a personal capacity and if it were so, then, he is a shareholder and caught by the law that the suit is a derivative action. I also disagree with the Respondents' alternative argument that leave to institute the action under a derivative action only affects procedural jurisdiction and not substantive jurisdiction. This suit was a derivative action. That being so, CAMA clearly provides that derivative actions must be instituted with leave of Court and this makes the requirement of leave in derivative actions a condition precedent and therefore, a substantive matter of law that goes to the jurisdiction of the Court. Therefore, leave of Court should have been obtained to file the suit as a derivative action. Also, notice should have been given to the Directors and the 2nd Respondent is the Managing Director so he cannot claim to be member who gave himself notice as contended. The condition of leave in derivative actions being a legal provision and a condition precedent to instituting any derivative legal action, does not merely affect the procedural jurisdiction of the Court but its substantive jurisdiction. It is one of the conditions bestowing jurisdiction on the Court that the suit be brought by due process. A defect against the condition of the substantive legal provision which requires leave for derivative action is a defect against the substantive jurisdiction of the Court, and has the effect of rendering the proceeding conducted therein, incompetent because substantive jurisdiction cannot be waived ...\" The Appellants in the present appeal conceded that they did not apply for and/or obtain leave of Court before commencing the present action, which they also agree is a derivative action. Their contention was that the leave they obtained in earlier derivative action against the Central Bank of Nigeria in Suit No FHC/L/CS/1286/2009 should be transported and allowed to abide in the present action. This is because, according to the Counsel to the Appellants, the leave of Court they obtained in the earlier action conferred on them a vested right to maintain their present claims, given that the earlier suit remained unresolved. Without engaging with the allusion to ''vested right\" to maintain an action made by the Counsel to the Appellants, it is commonsensical that whatever vested right claimed can and will only be in respect of the claims in the earlier action, Suit No FHC/L/CS/1286/2009, and not in the present action. The causes of action and the parties in the earlier action and in the present action are completely different and not similar in any material particular. The earlier action challenged the right of the Central Bank of Nigeria to interfere in the operations and governance of the first Appellant, while the present action questions the revocation of the operating banking license of first Appellant and the consequent takeover of its operations and management by the first and second Respondents, preparatory to its liquidation. The first and second Respondents were not parties to the earlier action and the Central Bank of Nigeria is not a party to this present action. The contention of the Counsel to the Appellants on the transferring of the leave obtained in the earlier action to this present action is thus completely baseless. The two lower Courts were correct in their findings that the present action is incompetent. I am one with the lead judgment that this appeal deserves to be dismissed. I too hereby dismiss the appeal. I affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal sitting in its Lagos Judicial Division and delivered on the 17th of July, 2017 in Appeal No. CA/L/448/2015.

      "FACTS": "Chief Gani Fawehinmi SAN, (now deceased) who died in 2009 but subsequently substituted by the present 1st respondent, his son commenced the action resulting in this Appeal by Originating Summons in the Federal High Court, Abuja. The Summons was supported by an Affidavit which deposed that he was a tax payer, chairman of a registered political party, former presidential aspirant and a Senior Advocate of Nigeria. He sought for declarations among others that the appellant, a Minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and Public Officer is not entitled to earn salaries above those prescribed by the Certain Political, Public and Judicial Office Holders (Salaries and Allowances, etc) Act No. 6 of 2002; that the yearly salary of $247,000 (about N36 Million) being paid to her violated the said Act which prescribes a yearly salary of N794,085 for every Minister. He also sought for an order compelling her to refund amount in excess of the prescribed salary. The appellant, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th respondents filed Notices of Preliminary Objection praying that the suit of the 1st Respondent be dismissed or struck out for lack of locus standi.  The Court upheld the preliminary objections and struck out the action. Being aggrieved he appealed to the Court of Appeal which allowed the appeal, set aside the ruling of the trial Court and invoked Section 15 of the Court of Appeal Act 2004 to grant the reliefs purportedly sought.

(7) That the salaries and allowances of Ministers and some other Public Officers have been prescribed in an Act of National Assembly titled \"Certain Political, Public and Judicial Office Holders (Salaries and Allowances, etc) Act No.6 of 2002 promulgated on 13th December, 2002 and deemed to have come into force on the 29th of May, 1999.

(10) That the 4th defendant is earning a yearly salary of $120,000 (about N17million) which is far above what the law has prescribed. (11) That the salaries being earned by the 3rd and 4th defendants were authorized by the President, General Olusegun Obasnajo the 1st defendant who swore to an oath of office prescribed in the seventh schedule of the Constitution to uphold the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on the 29th of May, 1999 and on the 29th of May, 2003. (12) That it is in the interest of justice to grant this application as the defendants would not be prejudiced if the plaintiff's claims are granted. (13) That I depose to this affidavit in support of the originating summons in good faith.\" Upon receipt of the appellant's counter-affidavit and notice of preliminary objection/ the claimant/plaintiff deposed to a further affidavit of 6 (six) paragraphs/ of which only paragraph 5 is relevant and it is hereby reproduced: \"(5) That I was informed by the plaintiff, Chief Gani Fawehinmi, SAN in our Chambers on Thursday 22nd April 2004 at about 6pm and I verily believe him that on the 10th day of September 2001 when he was sworn in as a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, (SAN) he swore to an oath before the Chief Justice of Nigeria and other Justices of the Supreme Court there present on the occasion of the conferment of the rank of Senior Advocate of Nigeria on him. A copy of the oath is attached herewith and marked Exhibit GANI 1.\" It should be noted that both the affidavit and further affidavit in support of the originating summons were deposed to by one Adindu Ugwuzor. As can be seen from the depositions in support of the originating summons, reproduced in this judgment, there is no deposition as to the claimant's interest, obligation or rights which had been infringed upon, violated or threatened with violation. Furthermore, there is no deposition to suggest that the action was a public interest litigation, in respect of which the Court can be liberal on the issue or question of the claimant's/plaintiff's locus standi. I think that the term \"public interest litigation\" refers or relates to an action or a suit instituted to protect or promote the interests of the general public, instead of pursuing a personal or private interest. The depositions in the affidavit in support of the 1st respondent's lawsuit, in the trial Court, tilted to the protection of only his personal interests as \"the Chairman of the National Conscience Party (NCP), former presidential candidate\" and \"as a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, (SAN)\" who \"swore to an oath before the Chief Justice of Nigeria and other Justices of the Supreme Court there present on the occasion of the conferment of the rank of Senior Advocate of Nigeria on him\". The claimant/plaintiff did not clearly display or show any locus standi to institute his suit in the trial Court. It is for the foregoing reasons and, more particularly, the fuller reasons given in the leading judgment that I also allow this appeal. I abide by the consequential orders made in the leading judgment. ABUBAKAR SADIQ UMAR, J.S.C.: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgment read by my learned brother, STEPHEN JONAH ADAH, JSC, I agree that this appeal has merit and that it should be allowed. I shall make a short comment on the issue of locus standi. My lords, the question of locus standi has received judicial consideration in many cases which have come before this Court, and the applicant has referred us to the case of Adesanya Vs. The President of Nigeria (2) (Supra). In the said case, the ratio decidendi was that when a man comes to Court and prays the Court to look into dispute between him and any person, or body he must show legal interest entitling him to ask for the intervention of the Court. In the case of Senator Adesanya Vs The President (2) (Supra) Idigbe, JSC at page 387, declared: \"the type of case or dispute which will Justify the exercise of the Court of its Judicial Power must to be Justiciable and based on a bonafide assertion of right by the litigant (or one of them) before it.\" All these authorities relate to civil matters and are not difficult to comprehend. The novel issue on this appeal is concerned with legal interest which the 1st Respondent must possess before he can commence proceeding. From the facts of the case Chief Gani Fawehinmi, SAN originated the action. His originating processes indicated he is a Nigerian; he was the Chairman of National Conscience Party. He was former presidential Candidate. He was a tax payer. A Senior Advocate of Nigeria etc. The question is, will the above be sufficient to grant him the locus standi to bring this action? These and other questions are bound to agitate the mind of any objective enquirer and it’s for this reason that the Court has to exercise some caution before giving a stamp of legality to this type of interest lest one flings open the door to busy-bodies who might want exploit the slightest opportunity to embarrass innocent citizens of this country. From the record of proceeding I read, the facts he is tax payer without facts of being such is fatal to his claim. In all these circumstances, I think that this appeal must succeed and I allow it. I hereby set aside the judgment of the lower Court. The originating summon, too is hereby struck out accordingly. Parties to bear their costs. Appeal Allowed.",

        "ABUBAKAR SADIQ UMAR, J.S.C.: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgment read by my learned brother, STEPHEN JONAH ADAH, JSC, I agree that this appeal has merit and that it should be allowed. I shall make a short comment on the issue of locus standi. My lords, the question of locus standi has received judicial consideration in many cases which have come before this Court, and the applicant has referred us to the case of Adesanya Vs. The President of Nigeria (2) (Supra). In the said case, the ratio decidendi was that when a man comes to Court and prays the Court to look into dispute between him and any person, or body he must show legal interest entitling him to ask for the intervention of the Court. In the case of Senator Adesanya Vs The President (2) (Supra) Idigbe, JSC at page 387, declared: \"the type of case or dispute which will Justify the exercise of the Court of its Judicial Power must to be Justiciable and based on a bonafide assertion of right by the litigant (or one of them) before it.\" All these authorities relate to civil matters and are not difficult to comprehend. The novel issue on this appeal is concerned with legal interest which the 1st Respondent must possess before he can commence proceeding. From the facts of the case Chief Gani Fawehinmi, SAN originated the action. His originating processes indicated he is a Nigerian; he was the Chairman of National Conscience Party. He was former presidential Candidate. He was a tax payer. A Senior Advocate of Nigeria etc. The question is, will the above be sufficient to grant him the locus standi to bring this action? These and other questions are bound to agitate the mind of any objective enquirer and it’s for this reason that the Court has to exercise some caution before giving a stamp of legality to this type of interest lest one flings open the door to busy-bodies who might want exploit the slightest opportunity to embarrass innocent citizens of this country. From the record of proceeding I read, the facts he is tax payer without facts of being such is fatal to his claim. In all these circumstances, I think that this appeal must succeed and I allow it. I hereby set aside the judgment of the lower Court. The originating summon, too is hereby struck out accordingly. Parties to bear their costs."

      "FACTS": "The Appellant was a Chartered Accountant and the Finance and Accounts Manager of African Petroleum Plc. It was alleged that he authorized the issuance of a Prospectus dated 30/3/2000 for offer of sale of shares of 86,400,000 ordinary shares of 50k each of N28.50 per share containing an untrue statement that the total indebtedness of the Company as at 30/6/1999 was N10.2 billion whereas subsequent revelations indicated that the Company’s indebtedness was over N22 billion. He was penalized by the Administrative Proceeding Committee (APC) of the Respondent on 19/4/2004. The Appellant alleged that he was not heard before the sanction was handed down to him as he did not appear before the said Committee. The Respondent on the other hand narrated that the Appellant with several other principal officers of the Company was served with hearing notice to appear before the Administrative Proceedings Committee (APC) but the he failed to appear. The Appellant filed a suit at the Federal High Court, Abuja, seeking to quash the decision of the Administrative Proceeding Committee (APC). The Court declined jurisdiction and transferred the case to the Investments and Securities Tribunal (1ST).

      "FACTS": "By way of an originating summons the Appellant (as Plaintiff) commenced this action before the High Court of Lagos State against the Respondents. It asked the Court to determine whether the Respondents can validly and rightly carry on and or operate any form of Lottery business within the territory of Lagos State without first obtaining a duly issued licence from the Executive Governor of the State in accordance with the provisions of the Lagos State Lotteries Law 2004. The Respondents filed a Notice of Preliminary Objection challenging the jurisdiction of the Court in that the issue raised directly or indirectly involve the validity of a license granted by the Federal government of Nigeria to the respondents for establishment of Lottery trade throughout the country and that such were within the  exclusive legislative list of the National Assembly, as such pursuant to the provisions of Section 251 (1) (p) and (r) of the Constitution it was the Federal High Court that is vested with the jurisdiction to entertain the matter.

      "HELD": "JURISDICTION – Jurisdiction of the State High Court vis a vis the Federal High Court –Jurisdiction of State High Court - Ambit of under Section 272 – Federal High Court - and 251 of the Constitution 1. that Courts of law being creatures of the statutes; including the Constitution, derive their jurisdiction to adjudicate over matters brought before them from the same statutes that create them, they therefore only exercise the jurisdiction conferred in them by such statutes; 2. that where jurisdiction is not conferred or vested in a Court under the statute which created or established it, then it cannot purport to assume and exercise jurisdiction it does not statutorily have; 3. that the jurisdiction vested or conferred on the High Court of a State in Nigeria to hear and determine the existence or extent of a legal, liability, interest or claim, etc, in civil proceedings, is very wide and extensive, made subject only to the provision of Section 251 and other provisions of the Constitution; 4. that the High Court of State possesses jurisdiction to adjudicate over cases/matters/actions which do not involve or affect the jurisdiction vested by or under Section 251 or other provisions of the Constitution in other Courts specifically named in the provisions; 5. that the jurisdiction conferred or vested in the High Court of a State under Section 272 of the Constitution, above, is made subject to, in particular, Section 251 of the Constitution; 6. that the High Court of a State would therefore lack and does not have jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate over matters for which the Federal High Court is specifically vested or conferred with jurisdiction under the provision of Section 251; 7. that in any civil action by which the validity of an executive or administrative action or decision by the Federal Government or any of its agencies is challenged and the reliefs for declarations and injunction are sought, it is the Federal High Court that exclusively possesses the requisite judicial power and authority or jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate by virtue of the provision in paragraph or item (r) of Section 251 (1); 8. that the answer lies in the nature, contents and context of the claims and the facts upon which the case is predicated, as disclosed in the originating summons as well as the Affidavit filed in support thereof; 9. that none of the Respondents who are unquestionably private companies could be said to be an agency of the Federal Government; 10. that all that the question seek to know from the trial Court is whether the Respondents can lawfully and validly operate, conduct or carry out the business of lottery in Lagos State without compliance with the requirement of the 2004 Law of Lagos State, such question does not raise the issue of the competence of or authority of any agency of the Federal Government to issue a licence to the Respondents; 11. that it is extraneous, as was erroneously done by the Court below, to import into the Appellant's case, the question of the validity of the licence issued to the Respondents as the only basis on which it concluded that the case sought to challenge an executive or administrative action of the Federal Government; 12. that the case presented in the Originating Summons filed by the Appellant before the trial Court is one which can be completely, effectually and finally determined without a determination of the validity of the licence issued to the Respondents since it was not raised in the question as well as the reliefs sought therein by the Appellant, the suit is simp...(truncated 36366 characters)...ties to an appeal, inspite or despite its views on one (1) or only some of those issues since its decision on the issues determined is subject to a further appeal at which it may be faulted in law, reversed and set aside. This position was restated by this Court in Adah v. NYSC (41) at 143 - 144, per Uwaifo, JSC in the lead judgment; a case decided years before the judgment appealed against, wherein His Lordship said:- \"The Court below, not being the final Court had a duty to decide the merit of the case upon the issues canvassed before it, notwithstanding that it resolved the issue of jurisdiction to the effect that the Benue State High Court lacked jurisdiction. This is because if an appeal to this Court was reversed on that issue, it would prevent the necessity of remitting the appeal to it to resolve the other issues arising from the appeal as originally made to it. See Ezeoke v. Nwagbo (1988) 1 NWLR (pt. 72) 616, Bayol v. Ahemba (1999) 7 SC (pt. 92) 92; (1999) 7 SCNJ 223. The Court below was in error to have failed to resolve all the issues canvassed before it rather than confine itself only to the issue of jurisdiction.\" Tobi, JSC, in his concurring judgment, restated that:- \"All Courts below the Supreme Court are bound to take all issues canvassed by the parties, even when such issues appear superfluous or spent. This is to enable the Court exercising appellate jurisdiction to determine the issues, even if in the alternative. I think this Court has the exclusive jurisdiction or should I say prerogative, to do what the Court of Appeal did because it is the final bus stop of any litigation.\" See Also Katto v. CBN (42), Titiloye v. Olupo (43), Cookey v. Fombo (44), Tanko v. UBA, Plc (45), Nwankwo v. Yar'adua (46), Toyrex Nig. Ltd. v. Pfizer (47) at 167. In the result, the Court below is clearly wrong in law to have failed/refused to consider and make pronouncements on the other issues canvased before it by the parties in the judgment appealed against and thereby unwittingly, infringing on the parties' right to fair hearing in the determination of the appeal. See Dasuki v. FRN (48) at 343, PDP v. INEC (49) at 556, Usararen v. FRN (50) at 234 (SC), Ikpeazu v. Otti (51). In the final result, I find merit in the appeal and allow it. As a consequence, the decision by the Court below that the trial Court lacks the requisite jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate over the Appellant's suit against the Respondents, delivered on the 16th July, 2008, is hereby set aside. The suit is restored on the Cause List of the trial Court for determination and ordered to be remitted to the Chief Judge of Lagos State for the purpose. The parties shall bear their respective costs of prosecuting the appeal. MUSA DATTIJO MUHAMMAD, J.S.C.: Being in entire agreement with the reasoning and conclusion expressed in the lead judgment of my learned brother, Mohammed Lawal Garba JSC, I adopt same in allowing the meritorious appeal. I also imbibe the consequential orders effected in the lead judgment. CHIMA CENTUS NWEZE, J.S.C.: I had the advantage of reading the draft of the leading judgment which my Lord, Garba, JSC, delivered now. I agree with His Lordship that this appeal, being meritorious, should be allowed. Section 251 (1) (r) of the 1999 Constitution, (as amended), provides that the Federal High Court shall have and exercise jurisdiction to the exclusion of any other Court in \"(r) any action or proceeding for a declaration or injunction affecting the validity of any executive or administrative action or decision by the Federal Government or any of its agencies.\" In effect, in actions under this provision, the Court would be required to resolve three Sub-questions (i) whether the claim relates to the validity of any executive or administrative action or decision; (ii) if the either of the parties is the Federal Government or any of its agencies and (iii) the nature of the reliefs, that is, whether they are for declaration; injunction; damages or specific performance. PDP v Sylva (52) at 52-53, G-E, Oloruntoba-Oju v. Dopamu (53) at 815-816; 829-830, A-C, University of Abuja v Ologe (supra) 722, PDP v Sylva (54) at 52-53, G-E, Ladoja v INEC (55) at 27-28, G-D, Obi v INEC (56) at 636-637, G-C; 638, B-E. I entirely agree with the leading judgment that the suit, culminating into this appeal, is simply one that is, entirely, based on the interpretation and application of the 2004 Laws of Lagos State in relation to the respondent's operation, conduct and carrying on the Lottery Business in Lagos State. It is for these, and the more elaborate, reasons in the leading judgement that I too hold that this appeal is meritorious. I hereby enter an order allowing it. I abide by the consequential orders in the leading judgment. UWANI MUSA ABBA AJI, J.S.C.: The Appellant as plaintiff in the trial Court sought for determination \"whether the Respondents can validly and rightly carry on, conduct and or operate any form of Lottery business within the territory of Lagos State by whatever means or mode without first obtaining a duly issued license from the Executive Governor of Lagos State in accordance with the provisions of the Lagos State Lotteries Law, 2004.\" It is clear that it is the interpretation of the \"provisions of the Lagos State Lotteries Law, 2004\" that the Appellant sought for. Thus, the ingredients and requirements for bringing a matter under Section 251 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) do not present themselves in this case to confer exclusive jurisdiction on the Federal High Court and not the State High Court. The trial Court rightly decided that the Appellant's suit \"seeks an interpretation of 2004 Lagos State Lotteries Law\" and not for \"determination of matters within the exclusive legislative list of the National Assembly of Nigeria\" and same is endorsed by me. My learned brother, Mohammed Lawal Garba, JSC, has sagely and with great judicial balance, handled the appeal and his reasoning and conclusion do not need tampering. I agree with him that the appeal be allowed. HELEN MORONKEJI OGUNWUMIJU, J.S.C.: I have read the draft of the judgment just delivered by my learned brother, Mohammed Lawal Garba, JSC. I agree with His Lordship's reasoning and conclusion that this appeal is meritorious and should be allowed. The judgment has been exhaustive on all the issues for determination and there is nothing useful to add to it. Appeal allowed.",

The Supreme Court is the final Court of justice in Nigeria and its decision is final. In short, the Supreme Court shall not review any judgment once given and delivered by it, save to correct any clerical mistake or some error arising from any accidental slip or omission or to vary the judgment or order so as to give effect to its meaning or intention. “Accident slip” in a judgment or order of a Court, means a classical error in a judgment or order of a Court, which must be an error in expressing the manifestintention of the Court. The Court will exercise its power to correct clerical errors or mistake arising from accidental slip or omission if nothing has intervened to make it inequitable to do so. Any other error outside this saving clause would not be permitted by the slip Rule since the judgment would then have represented what the Court decided and any alteration or variation would be a variation of the substantive part of the judgment. The inherent power of the Court can only be invoked if there is a missing link in the main body of the judgment and steps must be taken to fill the gaps or clear the ambiguity in the interest of justice. The exercise of this power should not be used to review or rehear the case or alter the rights and obligations of the parties under the ruling or order made.

(Nig) Ltd v.Yahaya (2005) 11 NWLR (pt. 935) pg. 181. Regardless of the foregoing, this Court has restated in many cases that it possesses inherent power to set aside its judgment in appropriate cases. The rationale behind the inherent power was amplified in the case ofAdegoke Motors Ltd v.Adesanya &Anor (1989) 5 SC pg. 113; (1989) 3- NWLR (pt. 109) pg. 250 at pg. 274 that: “We are final not because we areinfallible, rather we are infallible because we are final. Justices of this Court are human beings capable of erring. It will be short-sighted arrogance not to accept this obvious truth.” Such cases where this Court will set aside its judgment are:- 1.When the judgment is obtained by fraud or deceit either in the Court or of one or more of the parties.Alaka v.Adekunle (1959) LLR 76,Flawer v. Lloyd (1877) 6Ch.D pg. 297,Olufunmise v.Falana (1990) 3 NWLR (pt. 136) pg. 1. 2.Where the judgment is nullity and a person affected by the order of Courtwhich can be described as a nullity is entitled exdebitorjustitiae to have it set aside.Sken Consult Ltd v.Ukey (1981)1 SC 6; Craig v.Kamsen (1943) 1 KB 256.262 and 263,Ojiako and 7Ors v.Ogueze (1962) 1 SCNLR 112,Okafor &Ors v.Anambra State &Ors (1991) 6 NWLR (pt. 200) pg. 659 at pg. 680. 3.When it is obvious that the Court was misled into given judgment under a mistaken belief that the parties consented to it.Agunbiade v.Okunoga & Co., (1961) All NLR pg. 110,Obimonure v.Erinosho (1966) 1 All NLR pg. 250. 4.Where the judgment was given in the absence of jurisdiction.Madukolu v.Nkemdilim &Ors (1962) 2 SCNLR 341,Sken Consult v.Ukey (1981) SC 6. 5.Where the procedure adopted was such as to deprive the decision or judgment of the character of a legitimate adjudication.Igwe v.Kalu (2002) 14 NWLR (pt. 787) pg. 435,Alao v. ACB Ltd. (2000) 9 NWLR (pt. 672) pg. 264.” Rhodes-Vivour, JSC, in his concurrent decision, emphasized that:- “Consequently, once this Court has decided an issue and that decision is embodied in its judgment, and that judgment has been made effective, the Court no longerhas power to alter its decision which can no longer be questioned since it is final. It would amount to chaos for this Court to re-open the matter and substitute a different decision to the one already rendered.SeeAlao v. African Continental Bank Ltd. (2000) 9 NWLR (pt. 672) pg. 264,Chukwuka v.Ezulike (1986) 5 NWLR (pt. 45) pg. 892.” In the earlier case ofChukwuka v.Ezulike (13),Uwais, JSC (as he then was) had stated at page 1353, that:- “There is no appeal in the Court against the decision of 12th November, 1985 and it is obvious that there cannot be such an appeal since no jurisdiction has been conferred upon this Court to sit on appeal over its own decision, no matter how manifestly wrong the decision may be. See Paul Cardoso v. JohnBankole Daniel &Ors.(1986) 2 NWLR 1 at pg. 28.” I agree though, that as the final Court in the land, this Court is supposed to be a Court of policy on the law and so in the name and interest of public policy, evolved the aforementioned practice over the years of, very sparingly and in the identified extremely exceptional circumstances, departing from/setting aside its decisions on issues bordering on what was said to be “interest of Justice”, as enumerated above. However, the “justice” whose interest was to be protected by the practice is “Justice” according to the law, applied to the peculiar facts and circumstances of a given case. Since this application is not supported by any law, I join in dismissing it in terms of the lead judgment/ruling. ADAMU JAURO, J.S.C.: I have had a preview of the draft of the ruling just delivered by my learned brother, EmmanuelAkomayeAgim, JSC. Having equally read before now, the averments of the parties and submissions of their learned counsel contained in their respective affidavits and annexures attached thereto as well as Written Addresses, I cannot but concur with the reasoning and conclusion reached in the lead ruling, to the effect that the presentapplication is devoid of merit. The application is consequently dismissed. I abide by the order as to costs made in the lead ruling. TIJJANI ABUBAKAR, J.S.C.:My Lord and learned brother,EmmanuelAkomayeAgim, JSC granted me the privilege of reading in draft the elaborate leading judgment prepared and rendered in this appeal. I endorse the reasoning and conclusion and adopt the judgment asmine, I have nothing extra to add. I also endorse all consequential orders including the order on costs. Application Dismissed.",

      "FACTS": "The Appellant entered into a contract of supply with the 1st Respondent under which she was to supply 4 Cruise Boats. According to paragraph 8 of the Appellant’s claim, \"most of the negotiations of the contract\" between the parties took place in Abuja. Eventually, negotiations were concluded and the contract came into being. The Appellant supplied the Boats. Having executed the contract he made several demands for payment. The Respondents eventually paid the sum of N9,853,610.90 as part-payment. The Appellant issued a Writ of Summons in the Federal Capital Territory High Court, Abuja, under the Undefended List Procedure claiming the balance of the debt. The Respondents despite being served with processes declined entering any appearance nor filing any Notice of Intention to defend as enjoined by the Rules of the trial Court. In the absence of a Notice of Intention to defend, the trial Court was urged to invoke the provisions of Order 21 Rule 4 of the FCT High Court and to enter judgment for the Appellant. Judgment was accordingly entered for her as per the claims under the Undefended List. The Respondents appealed to the Court of Appeal, contending that the trial Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit as the parties involved were resident in, the contract entered into and executed in Port Harcourt, Rivers State. The appellate Court allowed the appeal holding that under Order 9, Rule 3 of the FCT High Court Rules, actions for breach of contract should be commenced where the contract ought to have been performed or where the Defendant resided. It further held that under the Section 255 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria which created the FCT High Court the Court has no jurisdiction as the matter has nothing to do with Abuja, FCT, but Port Harcourt, Rivers State. The Court, accordingly dismissed the suit. The Appellant has appealed to the Supreme Court",

        "Whether the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory Abuja, has jurisdiction to entertain a suit bordering on contract, where the parties to the contract reside in Port Harcourt and the contract entered and to be executed in Port Harcourt."
      ],
      "HELD": "1. that negotiation is at best a prelude to reaching an agreement; 2. that there may well be negotiation which does not germinate into a contract or agreement as a result of the inability to reach a compromise; 3. that territorial jurisdiction refers to the power or authority of a Court to adjudicate over matters which occur or arise within a territory or geographical area; 4. that the FCT is the territorial limit within which the trial FCT High Court is guaranteed in the exercise of the constitutional and other statutory jurisdiction vested or conferred on it. 5. that territorial jurisdiction implies a geographical area within which the authority of the Court may be exercised and outside which the Court has no power to act; 6. that in cases of breach of contract, the territorial jurisdiction to hear the case can be determined by reference to the following: (a) where the contract was made (lex loci contractus); (b) where the contract is to be performed (lex loci solutions); (c) where the defendant resides; 7. that Order 9 Rule 3 envisages that the contract must have been performed within the Federal Capital Territory to clothe the High Court with jurisdiction to determine the suit; 8. that a Court must not only have subject matter jurisdiction but also territorial jurisdiction to competently and properly adjudicate on any dispute brought before it; Obiter That there is no justification for the institution of the suit before the High Court of the FCT in Abuja, the filing of the such suit before that Court is a clear example of \"forum shopping\" in the hope of securing a favorable outcome, that practice has been seriously deprecated as it does not augur well for the administration of justice Appeal Dismissed",

        "ADAMU JAURO, J.S.C.: I have had the advantage of a preview of the judgment just delivered by my learned brother, Helen Moronkeji Ogunwumiju, JSC. I agree in toto with the reasoning and conclusion reached. The only relevant issue arising for determination is whether the lower Court was right in its decision that the Appellant's claim was outside the territorial jurisdiction of the High Court of the FCT. Territorial jurisdiction refers to the power or authority of a Court to adjudicate over matters which occur or arise within a territory or geographical area. See Veepee Ind. Ltd. v. O.F. (Nig.) Ltd. (50); Audu v. APC & Ors. (36) (Supra) (SC); Roda v. F.R.N. (51); Dariye v. FRN (26) (Supra) (SC). Some relevant provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) in relation to the jurisdiction of the High Court of the FCT are set out below. Section 6(2): \"The judicial powers of a State shall be vested in the Courts to which this Section relates, being Courts established, subject as provided by this Constitution, for a State.\" Section 6(5)(d): \"(5) This Section relates to – (d) the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.\" Section 255(1): \"There shall be a High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.\" Section 257: \"(1) Subject to the provisions of Section 251 and any other provisions of this Constitution and in addition to such other jurisdiction as may be conferred upon it by law, the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any civil proceedings in which the existence or extent of a legal right, power, duty, liability, privilege, interest, obligation or claim is in issue or to hear and determine any criminal proceedings involving or relating to any penalty, forfeiture, punishment or other liability in respect of an offence committed by any person. (2) The reference to civil or criminal proceedings in this Section includes a reference to the proceedings which originate in the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja and those which are brought before the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja to be dealt with by the Court in the exercise of its appellate or supervisory jurisdiction.\" Section 299: \"The provisions of this Constitution shall apply to the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja as if it were one of the States of the Federation; and accordingly- (a) all the legislative powers, the executive powers and the judicial powers vested in the House of Assembly, the Governor of a State and in the Courts of a State shall, respectively, vest in the National Assembly, the President of the Federation and in the Courts which by virtue of the foregoing provisions are Courts established for the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja; (b) all the powers referred to in paragraph (a) of this Section shall be exercised in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution; and (c) the provisions of this Constitution pertaining to the matters aforesaid shall be read with such modifications and adaptations as may be reasonably necessary to bring them into conformity with the provisions of this Section.\" The import of the foregoing provisions is that the jurisdiction of the High Court of the FCT does not extend beyond the geographical boundaries of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. Particularly, by virtue of Section 299 of the Constitution, the FCT High Court is no different from a State High Court serving the FCT. Thus, like the High Courts of the States of the Federation, the jurisdiction of the High Court of the FCT does not extend to matters arising outside the FCT. See Audu v. A.P.C. (36) (Supra); Mailantarki v. Tongo (25) (Supra). Although the Respondent did not enter an appearance or file a defence to the Appellant's suit before the trial Court, that cannot operate to vest jurisdiction on the Court when it clearly lacked same. The argument of the Appellant in this appeal is that the contract between the parties was made in Abuja, thus the trial Court had jurisdiction. In the Appellant's estimation the deposition in paragraphs 8 and 9 in its affidavit evidence before the trial Court was sufficient proof that the contract was made in Abuja. The said paragraphs 8 and 9 are set out below: \"8. That the negotiation most of which took place in Abuja was between the Managing Director of the Plaintiff and the Executive Head of State of the Defendants. 9. The Plaintiff accepted and as a result placed an order abroad and was supplied with four princess cruise boats which he eventually supplied to the Defendants.\" 10. The above paragraphs are not helpful in determining where the contract was made. They are only of assistance in telling us where the negotiation or most of it took place. Negotiation does not imply entering into an agreement or a contract. Negotiation is at best a precursor or prelude to reaching an agreement. There may well be negotiation which does not germinate into a contract or agreement as a result of the inability to reach a compromise. If negotiation was synonymous to making a contract as the Appellant is arguing, there would be no need to state in paragraph 9 of the Appellant's affidavit that \"the Plaintiff accepted...\" Hence, there is no proof that the contract was made in Abuja and the effect of this is that there is no element of the case that vests jurisdiction in the High Court of the FCT. The implication is that the trial Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the Appellant's claim. The claim as well as the entire proceedings before the trial Court are a nullity and hereby struck out. For these reasons and the more elaborate ones enunciated in the lead judgment, the appeal is also dismissed by me.",
        "TIJJANI ABUBAKAR, J.S.C.: I had the advantage of reading before now the comprehensive leading Judgment of my learned brother Helen Moronkeji Ogunwumiju, JSC. I endorse the entire reasoning and conclusion and adopt the judgment as my own. I have nothing extra to add."
